# Shopping Agent MCP Tool

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides product search capabilities using SerpAPI. The server returns structured product data, and the calling agent provides intelligent reasoning and recommendations.

## Features

- **Product Search**: Leverages SerpAPI (Google Shopping) to search across multiple retailers
- **Structured Data**: Returns rich product info including titles, prices, descriptions, thumbnails, ratings, and reviews
- **Agent-Driven Analysis**: The MCP server returns raw data; your AI agent analyzes and provides reasoning
- **Budget Awareness**: Product data includes prices for the agent to consider constraints
- **Configurable Results**: Limit search results (default 10, max 20) based on your needs

## Tools

### 1. `recommend_products`

Searches for products based on a natural language query and returns structured product data. The calling agent should analyze this data and provide intelligent reasoning.

**Parameters:**
- `query` (string, required): Natural language product request (e.g., "I want to buy a scarf for 40 dollars")
- `maxResults` (integer, optional): Maximum number of results (default: 10, max: 20)

**Returns:**
```json
{
  "query": "I want to buy a scarf for 40 dollars",
  "products": [
    {
      "name": "Cashmere Blend Scarf",
      "price": "$35.99",
      "description": "Soft and warm cashmere blend scarf in multiple colors...",
      "url": "https://example.com/product",
      "thumbnail": "https://example.com/image.jpg",
      "source": "Amazon",
      "rating": 4.5,
      "reviews": 120
    }
  ],
  "count": 5
}
```

**Features:**
- Returns rich structured product data including thumbnails and ratings
- The calling agent should analyze products and provide reasoning
- Products include names, prices, descriptions, and purchase URLs
- Only requires `SERPAPI_API_KEY` to function

### 2. `search_products`

Search for products across retailers (lower-level tool for raw search results).

**Parameters:**
- `query` (string, required): Product search query
- `maxResults` (integer, optional): Maximum results to return (default: 10, max: 100)

**Returns:**
Raw search results from SerpAPI.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package manager
- SerpAPI key (required for product search)

### Installation

1. **Get API Key:**
   - SerpAPI key: https://serpapi.com/manage-api-key

2. **Install Dependencies:**

```bash
cd mcp/shopping_agent
uv pip install -e .
```

### Configuration

Set the required environment variable:

```bash
export SERPAPI_API_KEY="your-serpapi-key"
```

Optional configuration:
```bash
export HOST="0.0.0.0"                     # Server host (default: 0.0.0.0)
export PORT="8000"                        # Server port (default: 8000)
export MCP_TRANSPORT="http"               # Transport type (default: http, Inspector-ready)
export MCP_JSON_RESPONSE="1"              # Force JSON responses (default: enabled)
export LOG_LEVEL="INFO"                   # Logging level (default: INFO)
```

## Running the Server

### Development Mode

```bash
cd mcp/shopping_agent
export SERPAPI_API_KEY="your-serpapi-key"
python shopping_agent.py
```

The server will start on `http://0.0.0.0:8000` by default and will return structured product data for your agent to analyze.

### Command-line options

You can override server behaviour with CLI flags:

```bash
uv run shopping_agent.py --json-response --port 8020
```

- `--json-response` / `--no-json-response`: toggle JSON responses without touching `MCP_JSON_RESPONSE`
- `--stateless-http` / `--stateful-http`: control FastMCP stateless HTTP mode
- `--host`, `--port`, `--transport`: override bind settings (fall back to environment variables when omitted)

### MCP Inspector Demo (HTTP Transport)

Follow these steps to debug the shopping agent with the official MCP Inspector UI:

1. Start the server on its own port using HTTP transport:
   ```bash
   cd mcp/shopping_agent
   export SERPAPI_API_KEY="your-key"
   MCP_TRANSPORT=http PORT=8001 python shopping_agent.py
   ```
2. In a new terminal (requires Node.js ≥18), launch the inspector:
   ```bash
   npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector
   ```
3. In the Inspector UI choose **Add server**, then supply:
   - Name: `Shopping Agent (HTTP)`
   - Transport: `HTTP` (or `Streamable HTTP` on older Inspector releases)
   - URL: `http://localhost:8001`
4. Click **Connect**, open the **Tools** tab, and invoke `recommend_products` or `search_products`. Responses stream in the right-hand panel.

Tip: run the `movie_tool` server on a different port (for example `PORT=8002 MCP_TRANSPORT=http python ../movie_tool/movie_tool.py`) to compare both MCP servers side by side inside the inspector.

### Using Docker

```bash
cd mcp/shopping_agent

# Build the image
docker build -t shopping-agent-mcp .

# Run the container
docker run -p 8000:8000 \
  -e SERPAPI_API_KEY="your-serpapi-key" \
  shopping-agent-mcp
```

## Architecture

The shopping agent MCP server provides product search data. The calling agent (your AI) provides reasoning and recommendations:

```
User Query → [MCP Tool] Search Products → Return Structured Data → [Your Agent] Analyze & Recommend
```

### Workflow

1. **MCP Server**: Receives query, searches SerpAPI, returns structured product data (no reasoning)
2. **Your Agent** (e.g., Claude, GPT-4): Analyzes the product data and provides intelligent reasoning for recommendations

### Suggested Agent System Prompt

When using this MCP server, configure your agent with a system prompt like this:

```
When users ask for product recommendations:
1. Use the recommend_products tool to search for products
2. Analyze each product considering:
   - How well it matches the user's requirements
   - Whether it fits within their budget
   - The value proposition (quality vs. price)
   - Any specific features mentioned in the query
3. For each product, provide:
   - A brief explanation of why it's a good match
   - A recommendation score (1-10)
   - Any caveats or considerations
4. Rank products by how well they match the user's needs
5. Present the top 3-5 recommendations with your reasoning
```

### Technologies Used

- **FastMCP**: MCP server framework
- **SerpAPI Python Client (`google-search-results`)**: Direct integration for real-time product search across retailers
## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Basic Product Search

```python
# Query
"I want to buy a scarf for 40 dollars"

# MCP Server Response (raw product data)
{
  "query": "I want to buy a scarf for 40 dollars",
  "products": [
    {
      "name": "Winter Wool Scarf",
      "price": "$38.99",
      "description": "100% merino wool...",
      "url": "https://example.com/product",
      "thumbnail": "https://...",
      "source": "Retailer A"
    },
    {
      "name": "Cashmere Blend Scarf",
      "price": "$35.99",
      "description": "Soft cashmere blend...",
      "url": "https://example.com/product2",
      "thumbnail": "https://...",
      "source": "Retailer B"
    }
  ],
  "count": 2
}

# Your Agent should then analyze these products and provide reasoning:
# "Here are my top recommendations:
# 
# 1. Winter Wool Scarf ($38.99) - Score: 9/10
#    This is an excellent choice within your $40 budget. The 100% merino wool 
#    provides superior warmth and quality, making it great value at this price point.
# 
# 2. Cashmere Blend Scarf ($35.99) - Score: 8/10
#    A more affordable option that still offers luxury with its cashmere blend..."
```

### Example 2: Specific Requirements

```python
# Query
"Find me wireless headphones under $100 with good noise cancellation"

# MCP Server Response (raw product data)
{
  "query": "wireless headphones under $100 with good noise cancellation",
  "products": [
    {
      "name": "Sony WH-CH710N Wireless Headphones",
      "price": "$89.99",
      "description": "Active noise canceling...",
      "url": "https://example.com/sony-headphones",
      "rating": 4.4,
      "reviews": 8500
    }
  ],
  "count": 1
}

# Your Agent analyzes and recommends:
# "I found the Sony WH-CH710N Wireless Headphones at $89.99 - this is an excellent 
# match for your requirements:
# - ✅ Wireless Bluetooth connectivity
# - ✅ Active noise cancellation feature
# - ✅ Well under your $100 budget ($89.99)
# - ✅ Bonus: 35-hour battery life
# 
# Recommendation Score: 9/10
# This product checks all your boxes and comes from Sony, a trusted brand in audio..."
```

## Testing

### Using Python Test Script

Test the shopping agent MCP server:

```bash
cd mcp/shopping_agent
export SERPAPI_API_KEY="your-serpapi-key"
python simple_test.py
```

This will test the product search functionality and show the structured data returned by the server.

### Using curl

You can also test the MCP server tools using curl:

```bash
# Test recommend_products tool (returns structured product data)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/mcp/tools/recommend_products \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: application/json, text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "query": "I want to buy a scarf for 40 dollars",
    "maxResults": 5
  }'
```

## Troubleshooting

### API Key Issues

**SerpAPI Key Issues:**
If you see "SERPAPI_API_KEY not configured" errors:
1. Get your key from https://serpapi.com/manage-api-key
2. Export it: `export SERPAPI_API_KEY="your-key"`
3. Restart the server

**General API Key Tips:**
1. Verify your API key is set correctly
2. Check that the environment variable is exported in the same shell session
3. Restart the server after setting environment variables

### No Results Returned

If searches return no results:
1. Try a more specific query with product name and budget
2. Check your SerpAPI quota at https://serpapi.com/dashboard
3. Review server logs for detailed error messages
