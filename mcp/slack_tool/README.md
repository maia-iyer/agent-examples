# Slack MCP Server

This is a simple Slack MCP Server with two tools:

- `get_channels` to list all public and private channels the bot has access to
- `get_channel_history` to list messages from a specific channel by `channel_id`

You can configure the server with the following environment variables:

| Variable name     | Required? | Default                | Description |
| ----------------- | --------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` | Yes       | `YOUR_SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` | Access token for the Slack server |
| `MCP_TRANSPORT`   | No        | `streamable-http`      | Passed into mcp.run to determine mcp transport |
| `ISSUER`          | No        | - | If populated, will attempt to extract bearer token, fail otherwise. Must be URI format |
| `HOST`            | No        | `0.0.0.0` | Configure the listen address of the MCP Server |
| `PORT`            | No        | `8000` | Configure the listen port of the MCP Server |

You can run this locally with `uv run slack_tool.py` so long as the `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` is set. 

## Auth setting

If `ISSUER` is set, the server will extract and print the bearer token, and fail if there is no bearer token. There is no official token validation at this time - this is purely for testing.
